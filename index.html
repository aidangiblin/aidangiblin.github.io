<h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
<h2>I'm using h1 and h2 within HTML to create alternative sized headings. This line (line 2) probably looks like it has a smaller font size</h2>
<h4>Soon, I'l implement a styles.css file, which allows me to customize the fonts and customize the page a bit further</h4>
