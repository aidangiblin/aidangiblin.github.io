        <h2>My Core Principles</h2>
        <p>I believe that technology should be used as a force for good, built on a foundation of respect for online user privacy. I am passionate about supporting ethically mission-driven businesses like B Corporations and Non-Profits, prioritising and committing to making positive social impacts. A long-term ambition of mine is to put these core principles into practice by one day founding my own B Corp-certified technology company, aiming to reshape the technology sector for the better.</p>
