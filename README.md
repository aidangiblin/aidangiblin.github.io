My Portfolio Website
This is my second official project on GitHub, folllowing my RatCatcher python project that I made with the help of Claude AI a while back. It was a great learning experience, helping me understand python better. I now know how indentation should be implemented, how to import libraries and how to use external libraries like the Discord Developers API and API keys for DeepSeek AI.
