Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. This is the central hub for my projects, my academic journey, and my work in ethical technology.

# About Me
I am currently a student studying a BTEC at Level 3 and an A-level course in Mathematics. I'm enrolled at a college for my BTEC and I've created a detailed schedule for my self-studied A-level Maths alongside some other commitments that can be found on my website.

# My Core Principles and Ethics
My projects are driven by a simple rule: ethics over money. But it isn't just about my projects; it's about how people live. I believe technology should be used as a force for good, grounded in a strong respect for user privacy, environmental and human welfare. I strongly reject the surveilance capitalism model that many companies have been forcing onto consumers. User privacy is important, with some of my projects reflecting this belief.

I believe that businesses should be focussing more on the environmental implications of their products, rather than meeting shareholder requirements and minimising the cost of manufacturing by cutting corners. This results in various pollution types such as plastic, air and water, each contributing to the degredation of the environment. I believe that businesses can still be driven by profit, but they should prioritise ethical boundries and consider the potential social and environmental impacts.

I support funding for reforestation, land conservation, and plastic cleanup schemes to help address pollution. I also actively research and audit my own household's food consumption and utilities usage to eliminate plastic waste and support ethical suppliers/businesses.

# Featured Projects
Whilst the full list of projects can be found on my website, some of my key projects include:

- **Home NAS Infrastructure**: A self-hosted, redundant server architecture built to replace commercial cloud services for media and backups. It utilizes Linux (Open Media Vault), Docker, and RAID 1 to manage media streaming, backups, and private game servers locally.
- **IoT Weather Analysis**: An engineering project to build a low-cost, local weather station using an ESP32 microcontroller. The goal is to collect environmental data and use Python to perform a comparative accuracy study against major algorithmic forecasts.
- **Household Ethical Audit**: A data-driven case study analyzing the cost and supply-chain impact of transitioning a household to near 100% ethical and plastic-free alternatives.
