Welcome. This repository serves as the central documentation for my engineering projects, academic progression, and research into ethical technology frameworks.

Academic Profile:
I am currently executing a hybrid academic strategy:
- Primary Qualification: BTEC Level 3 National Extended Diploma in Digital Technologies.
- Parallel Study: Self-directed A-Level in Mathematics.


Core Principles: Ethical Engineering
My technical work is defined by a "Rights-Based" approach to development. I prioritize three architectural standards:
1. Data Sovereignty: Rejecting the surveillance capitalism model by designing systems that retain user ownership of data.
2. Privacy-by-Design: Ensuring privacy is a default structural component, not an optional setting.
3. Supply Chain Accountability: Advocating for technology that accounts for environmental impact and labor standards, rather than solely optimizing for shareholder profit or manufacturing speed.


Featured Projects:
Sovereign Infrastructure (Home NAS):
A high-availability, self-hosted server architecture designed to eliminate reliance on commercial cloud providers.
Architecture: Linux (OpenMediaVault), Docker, and RAID 1 redundancy.
Function: Manages local media streaming, automated backups, and private game servers, ensuring zero-knowledge privacy and full data ownership.

IoT Micro-Climate Analysis:
An embedded systems engineering project utilizing ESP32 microcontrollers to capture hyper-local environmental data.
Objective: To conduct a comparative accuracy study between granular local sensor data and major algorithmic weather forecasts using Python for statistical analysis.

Ethical Supply Chain Audit (Data Science):
A quantitative analysis project mapping the relationships between consumer products and their parent entities.


Methodology: Using graph databases (Neo4j) to trace supply chains and calculate the "convenience tax" of ethical consumption.

Goal: To visualize the environmental and social impact of transitioning a standard consumer inventory to 100% certified ethical alternatives.
