​Portfolio & Academic Hub
​Welcome. This repository serves as the central documentation for my engineering projects, academic progression, and research into ethical technology frameworks.
​Academic Profile
​I am currently executing a hybrid academic strategy designed to bridge the gap between practical engineering and theoretical rigour:
​Primary Qualification: BTEC Level 3 National Extended Diploma in Digital Technologies.
​Parallel Study: Self-directed A-Level in Mathematics.
​This dual-track approach allows me to develop immediate software deployment skills while building the mathematical foundation required for high-level Systems Architecture.
​Core Principles: Ethical Engineering
​My technical work is defined by a "Rights-Based" approach to development. I prioritize three architectural standards:
​Data Sovereignty: Rejecting the surveillance capitalism model by designing systems that retain user ownership of data.
​Privacy-by-Design: Ensuring privacy is a default structural component, not an optional setting.
​Supply Chain Accountability: Advocating for technology that accounts for environmental impact and labor standards, rather than solely optimizing for shareholder profit or manufacturing speed.
​I view engineering as a tool for enforcing ethical standards in the digital economy, moving beyond "minimising costs" to "maximising sustainability."
​Featured Projects
​Sovereign Infrastructure (Home NAS)
A high-availability, self-hosted server architecture designed to eliminate reliance on commercial cloud providers.
​Architecture: Linux (OpenMediaVault), Docker, and RAID 1 redundancy.
​Function: Manages local media streaming, automated backups, and private game servers, ensuring zero-knowledge privacy and full data ownership.
​IoT Micro-Climate Analysis
An embedded systems engineering project utilizing ESP32 microcontrollers to capture hyper-local environmental data.
​Objective: To conduct a comparative accuracy study between granular local sensor data and major algorithmic weather forecasts using Python for statistical analysis.
​Ethical Supply Chain Audit (Data Science)
A quantitative analysis project mapping the relationships between consumer products and their parent entities.
​Methodology: Using graph databases (Neo4j) to trace supply chains and calculate the "convenience tax" of ethical consumption.
​Goal: To visualize the environmental and social impact of transitioning a standard consumer inventory to 100% certified ethical alternatives.
