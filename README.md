# My Professional Portfolio (aidangiblin.github.io / portfolio.aidangiblin.com)
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This site serves as a hub for my current academic pursuits, my personal projects (alongside my applied knowledge), and my professional development.

My first project on GitHub was a Python application built using the Discord and DeepSeek AI APIs. What started as an inside joke amongst friends became a valuable learning experience, introducing me to the basic of software development, APIs, and Git version control. While my interest in Computer Science began long before, this project was my first taste of actual programming. It was very fun to build and develop, but before deciding on a career I think that I should continue to pursue my BTEC to decide on a sector of the industry that interests me significantly.

# The purpose
What's the purpose of my site?:
- **Showcasing my projects:** I'm going to create detailed webpages for each of my projects. I will outline the problems I faced and the knowledge I gained after finishing my project.
- **Demonstrating my passions:** I have various interests in technology, particularly related to user privacy and ethical practices within this industry.
- **Documenting my journey:** As mentioned before, I'm documenting all ofthe projects I make. I'm also documenting my academic journey alongside this.
- **To discuss my ethical values:** This site is also designed to share my ethical principles. As an example, the aidangiblin.com domain is registered with a certified B Corporation. I love ethically mission-driven businesses and thrive to one day be a part of a company like this. I hope to one day run a B-corporation and implement my ethical values into something big.
